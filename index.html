    <p>My sketch was inspired by Max Bill, Square from Nine Rectangles, 1944</p>
    <p>I really enjoyed this project, and loved that we were able to interact in a way with the Harvard Art Museums' collection. In fact, I work at the Museums in our digital media department so it's great to see the collection that we've spent so much time digitizing being put to use! </p>
    <p>I chose the Max Bill painting as inspiration because of its simplicity and the colors the artist chose. I love the bright colors against a dark background. For my design, I wanted to preserve the main essence of the artwork as far as color and arrangement of shapes, but I varied the shapes and included new ones, along with a few other modifications. I tried to preserve the geometric simplicity and harmony of the original piece. </p>
    <p>Technically, this project was relatively approachable for me, although I did have a few problems getting the exact interactivity feature I wanted. I ended up using a onClick function, although I would've preffered a mouseOver (but couldn't get the colors to change slowly). I really enjoyed working on this!
